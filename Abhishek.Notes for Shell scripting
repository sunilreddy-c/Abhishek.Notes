we always start with shell script like
#!/bin/bash
always we need mentioned the author of the file 
#author sunil
#date 12-09-2024
#type shell
#version 0.1---->by using above comments we define the all owner details

set -x # debug mode 
set -e # thisnis used for script exits when there is an error.
set -o pipefile # is used to if there is any error in the pipe command it will through the error

#---it will ignore the lines its desnt execute the files

df -h ---it will shoes dixk space
free -g -- it will shows free memory
nproc -- to printing the resources
ps -ef -- (it will show the all processor details which are running in the linux server)

grep amazon |awk -F" " '{print $2}'--- for getting a procees id for that amazon files

set -x ---it is used to execute the script in debug mode (very useful to understand the script)
set +x ---it is used to stop the script in debug mode

how to find how many process are running in a server
command is --->ps -ef (it will show the all processor details which are running in the linux server)

in this ps -ef file i will find only which the name starts with amazon: for that command is (grep)
--->ps -ef | grep "amazon" (pipe) this command is used to get the output from first command and send it to the second command.

manager ask only a amazon processor id only:
---------------------------------------------
in this situation we can use (awk--pattern scanning and processing language ) command --->

this is interview question:
--------------------------
date | echo "this is "---> whats the uotput of this command --> it gives only a this 
reason:---> beacuse date command is system default command this send output to stdin from stdin pipe will not able to receive the output from the stdin
  pipe will not receive the information from the stdin command -- pipe only receive the information from the second command
 

 
curl command: curl command retrive the information from the internet | grep error ---> to get the all error logs
------------

wget command :wget command is used to download the content from the internet.
-------------

find command :find command is used to find a file which is locaed in somewhere in the server 
-------------
example : sudo find / -name pam.d -- here (/) indicates the home directory of root
